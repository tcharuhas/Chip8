Tyler's Chip8 Emulator

Through reading documentation such as http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM and looking at a bunch of source code on GitHub, I created a Chip8 Emulator in the language Rust. I made this mainly for a learning experience, as I plan to write a NES emulator or something of the sort in the near future.
