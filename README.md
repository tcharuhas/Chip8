# Tyler's Chip8 Emulator

Through reading documentation such as http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM and looking at a bunch of source  code on GitHub, I created a Chip8 Emulator in the language Rust. I made this mainly for a learning experience, as I plan to write a NES emulator or something of the sort in the near future.

# To Do as of 12/21/2020:

1. Update documentation in readme and code
2. Optimize certain parts of the code
3. Integreate tests
